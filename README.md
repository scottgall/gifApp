# gifApp

This app uses the Giphy API to retreive and display animated gifs.

The user can generate buttons with keywords of their choice and display gifs pertaining to those keywords by clicking said buttons.  Gifs will initially display as still images, and can be animated or stopped by clicking on the gif.  Gifs can be added to the 'favs' section, where they will remain until the tab is closed by clicking on the heart icon below the gif.  Additional gifs of the currently selected keyword may be displayed by clicking the 'add more' button.

This app uses Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and is best viewed in Goggle Chrome.
